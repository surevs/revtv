RevTV respects intellectual property rights and expects its users to do the same. This document outlines our response procedure for Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices.

### RevTV Does NOT:
- Host, store, or cache any copyrighted video content
- Provide unauthorized access to paid content
- Circumvent Digital Rights Management (DRM) protections
- Redistribute or rebroadcast streaming content

### RevTV Does:
- Provide a user interface to access streaming services

- Respect content provider authentication mechanisms

## Filing a DMCA Notice

If you believe RevTV infringes on your copyright, please provide:

1. **Identification** of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed
2. **Identification** of the material that is claimed to be infringing
3. **Contact information** (address, telephone number, email)
4. **Good faith statement** that the use is not authorized
5. **Accuracy statement** under penalty of perjury
6. **Physical or electronic signature** of the copyright owner

## Counter-Notification

If you believe your content was wrongly removed, you may submit a counter-notification containing:

1. Your physical or electronic signature
2. Identification of the removed material
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed by mistake
4. Your consent to jurisdiction in your local federal court

## Important Note

Since RevTV is a client-side application that accesses third-party APIs and does not host any content, most DMCA takedown requests may not be applicable. We encourage rights holders to address content concerns directly with the hosting streaming services.
